    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>I devised this apple crisp with cranberry sauce recipe when I was trying to use up that leftover homemade cranberry sauce from Thanksgiving! You could probably also use canned whole cranberry sauce for this recipe.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 Granny Smith apples, peeled, cored, and sliced</li>
        <li>1 ½ cups whole berry cranberry sauce</li>
        <li>1 cup whole wheat pastry flour</li>
        <li>1 cup rolled oats</li>
        <li>⅔ cup packed brown sugar</li>
        <li>½ cup butter, melted</li>
        <li>⅔ teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Place apple slices in an 8- or 9-inch square baking dish; spread cranberry sauce over top. Combine flour, oats, brown sugar, butter, and cinnamon in a bowl until crumbly; sprinkle over apple-cranberry mixture until completely covered.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until apples are easily pierced with a knife and topping is browned, about 45 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
