    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This Salisbury steak meatballs are easy to make and pack a lot of flavor. Simmered in mushroom gravy, they come out soft and delicate without falling apart. Serve over mashed potatoes or rice.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound lean ground beef</li>
        <li>3/4 cup panko bread crumbs</li>
        <li>1/2 cup grated onion</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon ketchup</li>
        <li>3 1/2 teaspoons Worcestershire sauce, divided</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons mustard powder</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
        <li>12 ounces crimini mushrooms, sliced</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons all purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 cups beef stock</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons ketchup</li>
        <li>parsley for garnish</li>
        <li>mashed potatoes, for serving</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
        <li>Combine the ground beef, panko bread crumbs, onion, egg, 1 tablespoon ketchup, 1 1/2 teaspoons Worcestershire sauce, mustard powder, salt, and pepper in a large bowl. Mix until just combined.</li>
        <li>Shape mixture into 20 (1 1/2-inch) meatballs.</li>
        <li>Add olive oil to a large skillet and heat over medium-high heat. Cooking in batches, add half the meatballs to the skillet and brown on all sides, about 5 minutes. Meatballs will not be fully cooked. Remove the meatballs from the skillet; set aside.</li>
        <li>Reduce heat to medium and add butter to the skillet. Once melted, add mushrooms and cook until golden brown. Add flour to the mushrooms and cook for 1 minute. Slowly whisk in beef stock, the remaining 2 teaspoons Worcestershire sauce, and 2 teaspoons ketchup. Bring mixture to a simmer, whisking constantly, until thickened, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Return meatballs to the skillet. Spoon gravy over meatballs. Cover and cook until heated through and meatballs are done (160 degrees F or 72 degrees C), about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Top the meatballs with chopped parsley and serve with mashed potatoes.</li>
    </ol>
